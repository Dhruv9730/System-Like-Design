# ðŸ”¥ Smart Like System â€“ Social Media Simulation using DSA & API Data

This project simulates a simplified version of how a **"Like" system** works in platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn. It uses **core data structures and algorithms (DSA)** to manage likes, undo functionality, and trending analytics â€” all built in Python.

> ðŸ’¡ Real API Data + Real-Time Simulation + Clean DSA Logic
